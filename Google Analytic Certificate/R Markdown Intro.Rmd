## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring: 

* HTML 
* PDF 
* MS Word documents 

For more details on using R Markdown click here [link](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![Nong Winter Narak Thee sud](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/12/1600x900/aespa_Winter_1712911136869_1712911149714.jpg)

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
